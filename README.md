*In testing. Not yet hooked up to twitter API*

This project was based on the SombreroWatch repository and twitter account by joemfox. Uses SQLite3 instead
of a file-based approach to save tweet and event data.

Scrapes MLB data daily using BeautifulSoup and will send a tweet out when the STL Cardinals hit a home run, and will tweet the score at the beginning of the 3rd, 6th, 9th, each extra inning, and the final score.

The job is scheduled using APScheduler.

Found a bug or have a suggestion? Feel free to direct message the @CardinalDingerz twitter account!
